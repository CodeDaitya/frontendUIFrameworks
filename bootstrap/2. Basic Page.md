# Basic Bootstrap Page

## HTML5 doctype

The HTML structure works in the same manner as in any other webpage.


```html
<DCOTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
  </head>
</html>
```

## Mobile-first styles

As observed before, bootstrap is a mobile-first framework and has mobile-first styles at its core. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming
following `<meta>` is added in the `<head>`.

```html
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device_width, initial-scale=1">
```

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).  
The initial-scale=1 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

## Containers

Bootstrap wraps the site contents in containers. There are two types of containers:  
  
	1. The `.container` class provides a **responsive width container**
	2. The `.container-fluid` class provides a **full width container**, spanning the entire width of the viewport

The container `div` cannot be nested in another container.

So the basic Bootstrap page will be written something this:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Bootstrap Example</title>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">
        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
        <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
       <div class="container-fluid">
          <h1>My First Bootstrap Page</h1>
          <p>This is some text.</p>
       </div>
    </body>
</html>
```
